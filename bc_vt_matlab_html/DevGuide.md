# Batch Connect - Matlab app 

An example Batch Connect app that launches a Matlab application within a
batch job.

## Prerequisites

This Batch Connect app requires the following software be installed on the
**compute nodes** that the batch job is intended to run on (**NOT** the
OnDemand node):

- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) 1.0.1+ (used to hash the Jupyter Notebook
  server password)
- [Lmod](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/research-development/tacc-projects/lmod)
  6.0.1+ or any other `module purge` and `module load <modules>` based CLI
  used to load appropriate environments within the batch job before launching
  the Jupyter Notebook server.
- [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html) Singularity is a container platform. It allows you to create and run containers that package up pieces of software in a way that is portable and reproducible. ... Your container is a single file, and you don't have to worry about how to install all the software you need on each different operating system and system.

## Downloading and building docker image
``` sh 
    singularity pull matlab.sif docker://vtarc/bc_vt_matlab_html:latest
```

- Change the Sif file locations in [script.sh.erb](https://github.com/AdvancedResearchComputing/OnDemandApps/blob/233185f8f1e7115bde8129d4356860056754f6f4/bc_vt_matlab-html/template/script.sh.erb#L31)


### Development Installation

```bash
   cd /home/<user>/ondemand/dev
