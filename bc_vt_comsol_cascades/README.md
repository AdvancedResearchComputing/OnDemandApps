# Batch Connect - VT COMSOL Multiphysics

A Batch Connect app designed for [Advanced Research Computing]'s VT OnDemand that launches COMSOL Multiphysics
within a Cascades batch job.  For other apps and assistance with Open OnDemand, see [Open OnDemand].

## Prerequisites

This Batch Connect app requires the following software be installed on the
**compute nodes** that the batch job is intended to run on (**NOT** the
OnDemand node):

- [COMSOL Multiphysics] 5.1+  
- [Xfce Desktop] 4+  

For VNC server support:

- [TurboVNC] 2.1+  
- [websockify] 0.8.0+  

For hardware rendering support (coming soon ...):

- [X server]  
- [VirtualGL] 2.3+  

**Optional** software:

- [Lmod] 6.0.1+ or any other `module purge` and `module load <modules>` based
  CLI used to load appropriate environments within the batch job

## Install

Use git to clone this app:

```sh
git clone <repo>
cd <dir>
```

You will not need to do anything beyond this as all necessary assets are
installed. You will also not need to restart this app as it isn't a Passenger
app.

Again, you do not need to restart the app as it isn't a Passenger app.
