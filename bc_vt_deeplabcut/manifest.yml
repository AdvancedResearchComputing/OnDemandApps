  This app will launch a [DeepLabCut] in a container on one node.  Currently works on [TinkerCliffs] and [Infer].  For issues or requests, please submit a github issue for the [desktop OOD app] or the [desktop container].<P>  **NOTE** this app does not work without installing DeepLabCut in your profile first, so the first time you use this app it will take ~5min to start!!
