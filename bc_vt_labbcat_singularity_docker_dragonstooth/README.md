# Batch Connect - VT LaBB-CAT

A Batch Connect app designed for Advanced Research Computing's VT OnDemand that launches LaBB-CAT
and an associated MySQL server within a DragonsTooth batch job. Both are launched via Singularity 
containers. For other apps and assistance with Open OnDemand, see [Open OnDemand].

## Prerequisites

This Batch Connect app requires the following software be installed on the
**compute nodes** that the batch job is intended to run on (**NOT** the
OnDemand node):

<LIST DEPENDENCIES>
- Singularity 3.5.1

**Optional** software:

- [Lmod] 6.0.1+ or any other `module purge` and `module load <modules>` based
  CLI used to load appropriate environments within the batch job

[Advanced Research Computing] https://arc.vt.edu/  
[LaBB-CAT]: http://labbcat.sourceforge.net/
[Lmod]: https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/research-development/tacc-projects/lmod  

## Install

Use git to clone this app:

```sh
git clone <repo>
cd <dir>
#pull the mysql-server image
singularity pull docker://mysql/mysql-server:5.6
#pull the labb-cat image
labbcatver="20200916.2050"
singularity pull --name labbcat_${labbcatver}.sif docker://nzilbb/labbcat:$labbcatver
```

You will not need to do anything beyond this as all necessary assets are
installed. You will also not need to restart this app as it isn't a Passenger
app.

Again, you do not need to restart the app as it isn't a Passenger app.
