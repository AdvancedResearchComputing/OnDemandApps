  This app will launch [TMUX] on [TinkerCliffs] and [Infer] -- coming soon.  The underlying desktop container is based off the awesome Xfce image by [accetto].
  Once the application launches, an interactive terminal will also be launched. Enter the `bash` command to exit out of the Singularity shell and use the following command to start a TMUX session. `tmux new-session -s session-name -d`
