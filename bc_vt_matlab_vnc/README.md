# Batch Connect - MATLAB via VNC

[![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

An interactive app designed for VT OnDemand that launches a [MATLAB] batch job.

## Prerequisites

This Batch Connect app requires the following software be installed on the
**compute nodes** that the batch job is intended to run on (**NOT** the
OnDemand node):

- [Lmod] 6.0.1+ or any other `module restore` and `module load <modules>` based
  CLI used to load appropriate environments within the batch job before
  launching the Singularity image.

- [Singularity] 3.7.1+
- Singularity image similar to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
- Corresponding module to launch the above Singularity image (see
  [example_module])

[Singularity]: http://singularity.lbl.gov/
[Lmod]: https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/research-development/tacc-projects/lmod
[example_module]: https://github.com/nickjer/singularity-rstudio/blob/master/example_module/

## Install

Use git to clone this app and checkout the desired branch/version you want to
use:


XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Ayush - fix me

```sh
scl enable git19 -- git clone <repo>
cd <dir>
scl enable git19 -- git checkout <tag/branch>
```

You will not need to do anything beyond this as all necessary assets are
installed. You will also not need to restart this app as it isn't a Passenger
app.

To update the app you would:

```sh
cd <dir>
scl enable git19 -- git fetch
scl enable git19 -- git checkout <tag/branch>
```

Again, you do not need to restart the app as it isn't a Passenger app.
